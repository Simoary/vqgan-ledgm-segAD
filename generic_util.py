Simoary: I have taken this script for MVTEC3D-AD evaluation code to calculate AUPRO.

Various utility functions for:

    - computing the area under a curve.

    """
    This function calculates the definit integral of a curve given by
    x- and corresponding y-values. In contrast to, e.g., 'numpy.trapz()',
    this function allows to define an upper bound to the integration range by
    setting a value x_max.

    Points that do not have a finite x or y value will be ignored with a
    warning.

    Args:
        x:     Samples from the domain of the function to integrate
               Need to be sorted in ascending order. May contain the same value
               multiple times. In that case, the order of the corresponding
               y values will affect the integration with the trapezoidal rule.
        y:     Values of the function corresponding to x values.
        x_max: Upper limit of the integration. The y value at max_x will be
               determined by interpolating between its neighbors. Must not lie
               outside of the range of x.

    Returns:
        Area under the curve.
